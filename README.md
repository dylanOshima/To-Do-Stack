# TO-DO STACK
A simple way for me to organize what I need to do and prioritze my stuff. Made with **React.js** and maybe some **Node.js**. Let's see :D.
---
## Running
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run`

## Dependencies
* react-responsive

## Features
* Stack Format (ignore function names... for now)
* Infinite blocks
* Can add and remove blocks

## TODO
3. Clickable blocks
4. Implement input form for creating new blocks
1. Fix the window `height` so that it is `100vh`
2. ~~Allow for infinite stacks~~
  1. ~~You can scroll through the stack while keeping window size constants~~
  2. Discrete window stops. When I scroll, I scroll through specific blocks.
